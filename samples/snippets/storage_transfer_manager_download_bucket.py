    The max_results option can be set to None to download all of the blobs
    regardless of how many there are, but this function fetches and queues all
    of the blob names at once, which can be taxing on memory in cases of very
    large numbers of blobs.

    The filename of each blob once downloaded is derived from the blob name and
    the `destination_directory `parameter. For complete control of the filename
    of each blob, use transfer_manager.download_many() instead.

    Directories will be created automatically as needed, for instance to
    accommodate blob names that include slashes.
